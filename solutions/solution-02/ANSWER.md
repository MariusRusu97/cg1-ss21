# Assignment 2: Mesh

## Task 1

- [1.5/1.5] 1.1:
v 3 0 3 
v -3 0 -3
v -3 0 3
v 3 0 -3
v 0 5 0
f 2 4 5
f 4 1 5
f 1 3 5
f 3 2 5
f 2 3 1 4

- [1.5/1.5] 1.2 a): 5v, 6f (split baseplate along diagonal)
- [1.5/1.5] 1.2 b): 5v, 5f (no change)
- [1.5/1.5] 1.2 c): 17v, 13f (add one vertex at the middle of each side of the triangle and one inside the triangle (e.g. at the bayrcenter))
OR: 11v, 9f (concave quads!) (one vertex at one side of each triangle (shared edges) and one inside.)
- [0.5/0.5] 1.2 type of mesh in 1.1 (here quad-dominant mesh) 

- [1/1] 1.3 a): l (line) for the pole, v and f for the flag.
- [1/1] 1.3 b): the flagpole is not part of any face; non-manifold; or similar.
- [1.5/1.5] 1.3 c): E.g. Morphing the flagpole into a thin cuboid and adding thickness to the flag
